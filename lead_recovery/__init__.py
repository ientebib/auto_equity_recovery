"""lead_recovery package

This lightweight package wraps the existing topâ€‘level modules so they can be
imported as `lead_recovery.<module>` without physically moving every file at
once.  It lets us install the project as `pip install -e .` and run the CLI via

    python -m lead_recovery.cli  # or simply: lead-recovery  (via console script)

When we later move modules into this folder we can drop these indirections.
