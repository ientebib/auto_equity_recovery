CONVERSATION HISTORY:
{conversation_text}

Please analyze the conversation provided. Based on the interaction, determine the most fitting 'primary_stall_reason_code' from the predefined taxonomy below and provide a concise 'summary_what_went_wrong'.

Output your analysis in valid YAML format:
```yaml
primary_stall_reason_code: "CHOOSE_ONE_FROM_TAXONOMY_BELOW"
summary_what_went_wrong: "Un resumen breve y factual EN ESPAÑOL explicando por qué el lead no procedió, basado en la conversación."
```

**Primary Stall Reason Code Taxonomy (Choose one):**

- VEHICULO_ANTIGUO_KM
  *Condition: User states the vehicle is too old or has too many kilometers based on Kuna's criteria (e.g., older than 2008, >200,000 km).

- NO_PROPIETARIO
  *Condition: User indicates they are not the registered owner of the vehicle, or the vehicle is registered to a company/third party. 

- VIN_EXTRANJERO
  *Condition: User states the Vehicle is foreign, or the car was imported and might not have standard Mexican registration/plates suitable for a loan guarantee.*

- ZONA_NO_CUBIERTA
  *Condition: User's location or where the vehicle is registered is outside Kuna's operational coverage area.*

- PROBLEMA_SEGUNDA_LLAVE
  *Condition: User explicitly states they do not have the second key (duplicate) for the vehicle, and this becomes a blocker after Kuna asks for it.*

- PROBLEMA_TERMINOS
  *Condition: User expresses dissatisfaction or concern specifically about the loan terms offered (e.g., interest rate, monthly payment, loan amount being too low, loan duration, CAT, insurance requirements) and then stops responding, or ghosts immediately after the offer is presented or after asking detailed questions about the terms.*

- GHOSTING
  *Condition: User stops responding without a clear preceding reason like explicit disinterest, term issues, or a stated problem. This applies if the user was engaged and then suddenly goes silent at any stage before a clear resolution or explicit withdrawal.*

- ERROR_PROCESO_INTERNO
  *Condition: Kuna's team or system made an evident mistake, e.g., failed to follow up as promised, or a significant delay from Kuna that caused the user to disengage.*

- RECHAZADO_POR_KUNA
  *Condition: The conversation shows Kuna explicitly informed the lead that their application or vehicle was rejected for reasons not fitting other specific codes (e.g., failed internal checks, risk assessment, not just vehicle age/VIN but a more general Kuna rejection).*

- PRODUCTO_INCORRECTO_COMPRADOR
  *Condition: User explicitly states they are looking for a loan to *buy* a car, rather than using their *current* car as a guarantee for a personal loan. Kuna AutoEquity is for leveraging an owned asset, not for vehicle purchase financing.*

- OTHER_BUSINESS_PROCESS
  *Condition: The conversation indicates the lead is involved in a different, concurrent Kuna process (e.g., selling their car to Kavak, a different loan type) that takes precedence or complicates this specific AutoEquity application.*

- FINANCIAMIENTO_ACTIVO
  *Condition: User states the vehicle they intend to use as collateral still has an active loan or financing from another institution. Kuna requires the vehicle to be fully paid off.*

- ADEUDO_VEHICULAR_MULTAS
  *Condition:  where the user explicitly mentions unpaid fines (multas) or tenencias or traffic violations as the primary debt on the vehicle preventing its use as collateral, only if this exceed 35,000 MXN.*


Focus on the historical interaction to understand the breakdown point. The 'summary_what_went_wrong' should clearly explain the context of the stall, EN ESPAÑOL.

Use reasoning and think harder.
