You are analyzing WhatsApp conversations from Mexican leads who received pre-approved loan offers.

I will ONLY ask you to analyze conversations where:
1. The lead received an offer
2. The lead clicked "Me interesa"
3. The lead then received a handoff invitation message

CONVERSATION:
{conversation_text}

IF the lead didn't click "Me interesa" on the initial offer OR never received a handoff invitation, 
REPLY ONLY WITH: "NO_ANALYSIS_NEEDED"

OTHERWISE, analyze the conversation and provide your results in YAML format:

```yaml
handoff_progress: [NOT_STARTED, STARTED_BUT_ABANDONED, COMPLETED]
stall_reason: [SPECIFIC REASON the user abandoned the process - be precise about where they stopped]
suggested_followup: [Personalized message to help user complete the handoff]
```

Focus your analysis on what happened AFTER the user clicked "Me interesa" and received the handoff invitation.
